# WIP

In this repository, I collect the stuff that I am currently working on or want
to look into but which doesn't have its own repository yet.
Ideally, there should be only snippets of ideas of what to look into, I am to
start repositories for the things I start working on as soon as I do.

- [ ] Look into Act - a local GitHub Actions runner

  https://github.com/nektos/act

  I am not bothered by pushing dozens of commits to tweak a GitHub Actions
  workflow, but I should still check Act out, because I might be even less
  bothered by using it to tune my workflows if it is easy to install and use.

- [ ] Look into Nix - macOS package manager

  https://github.com/NixOS/nix

  Nix, AFAICT, should be a good way to install software and utilities on macOS
  without feeling like I am cluttering up my computer and getting bad
  interactions between programs running on it. This is different from straigh up
  using Nix, the OS! This item is about looking into the package manager on
  macOS.

- [ ] Try out Supabase Auth "Allow new users to sign up" option

  Some time ago I filed https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/issues/330
  
  It seems as though nowadays Supabase Auth has a new option to prevent signups
  while still keeping signins enabled:
  
  https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/issues/190
  
  I should check that out and write about it. Maybe create a demo of a community
  site with either invite-based or just fixed membership records.
